# Heap-Data-Structures-Implementation-Analysis-and-Applications

## Overview of the Project
The project explores the concept and analysis of two heap-based systems, a max-heap that could be applied to Heapsort, and a min-heap that could be implemented as a priority queue when scheduling tasks. The research would be useful to learn the way heap-based algorithms can enhance sorting performance and allow dealing with the prioritization of tasks under different working conditions. Its results shed light on anthropomorphic behaviors in performance, computational complexity and structural designs upon their implementation with array-based representations.

## Instructions for running the programs
In order to run the Python-based implementations, the Python environment will need to be setup. The program with the sorting method based on a max-heap has to be executed to call the Heapsort algorithm. The unordered array is presented, and then the sorted one is set hereafter having been processed by Heapsort. In order to test a priority queue, the file where the min-heap based task scheduler is to be run must be implemented. The output also shows task insertion, tasks extraction of priority, changing the priority of a task, and the condition of the queue after the task. Every file has provided sample data and incorporated test cases that help in validating the behavior of every algorithm under the simulation of task loads and inputs of the various sorts.

## Findings and Observations
A set of experimental research was carried out to evaluate the Heapsort algorithm behavior, using it on random, sorted and reverse-sorted input arrays. Its time performance was found to be similar between the various array setups; and the fact that it has a predictable time complexity and in-place sorting property makes it especially labor-friendly in situations where the memory resources are limited. Even though Quicksort performs better in both practice and expected average case, Heapsort provides a deterministic worst-case guarantee and lower space requirements. It is more efficient in terms of memory usage and non-recursiveness, hence adding other benefits compared to the Merge Sort.

Simultaneously, the priority queue was introduced and tested as a paradigm of application to real-life scheduling. The structure has properties and characteristics of min-heaps, and ensures that the most urgent job is performed first. The theoretical expectation was supported empirically, particularly in terms of time-complexity, which is why it is effective when it comes to dynamic, real-time, scheduling applications on devices with limited computing capabilities.
